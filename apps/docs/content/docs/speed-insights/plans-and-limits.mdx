### What counts toward the quota?

Every reported metric measurement is **one data point**. A single page view may generate multiple data points (one per metric).

### Plan limits

- **Free**: up to **5,000** Speed Insights **data points**
- **Pro**: up to **20,000** Speed Insights **data points**

If you exceed your quota, new data points may be dropped until the quota resets or you upgrade your plan.
