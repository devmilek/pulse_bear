## What is Speed Insights?

PulseBear Speed Insights is real‑user monitoring (RUM) for front‑end performance. Instead of running a single synthetic test, it collects metrics directly from your users’ browsers — on their devices, networks, and real conditions — and visualizes them in your PulseBear dashboard.

You get the actual experience your visitors have in production, not a lab estimate.

## Why PulseBear over Lighthouse?

- Data source
  - PulseBear (RUM): field data from real users, 24/7.
  - Lighthouse: lab/synthetic test run on demand (local or CI).
- Coverage
  - PulseBear: continuous collection across your entire app.
  - Lighthouse: one URL per run.
- Context
  - PulseBear: real devices, browsers, extensions, cache state, and networks (3G/4G/Wi‑Fi).
  - Lighthouse: controlled, emulated environment.
- Aggregation
  - PulseBear: percentiles (p50/p75/p90), trends over time, segmentation.
  - Lighthouse: single snapshot score per run.
- Actionability
  - PulseBear: pinpoints which routes degrade user experience.
  - Lighthouse: great audits and recommendations, but not representative of production usage.

Note: Lighthouse is still valuable for local debugging and prevention in CI. PulseBear complements it with field data that reflects what users actually feel.

## Per‑route visibility

PulseBear maps metrics to concrete routes in your app so you can:
- See which routes are Good, Needs improvement, or Poor at a glance.
- Prioritize the paths that impact users the most (e.g., /checkout vs /blog).
- Understand layout/code differences across pages.
- Aggregate dynamic routes (e.g., `/product/[id]`) into a single pattern for cleaner analysis.

## Metrics collected

- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): how quickly the main content appears.
- FCP (First Contentful Paint): first pixel of content on screen.
- INP (Interaction to Next Paint): responsiveness to user interactions.
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): visual stability of the page.
- TTFB (Time to First Byte): server response latency.

Each metric is available with p50/p75/p90 percentiles and filters by route, device, and browser.

## What you gain

- Representative, trustworthy data about real UX in production.
- Clear prioritization based on which routes and segments are slow.
- Trend tracking and quick regression detection after deployments.
- Better decisions than relying on a single Lighthouse score.

## How it fits your workflow

- Use PulseBear to monitor production continuously and spot regressions early.
- Use Lighthouse locally/CI to investigate and apply specific audit recommendations.
- Iterate: fix, deploy, and verify improvements in PulseBear’s
