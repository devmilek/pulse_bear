## Metric cards

Selecting a metric shows a **score card** with:

- The current **percentile** value (default **p75**)
- **Data points** used for that value
- A **time series chart** of the selected percentile over the chosen **time range**

## Route breakdown

Below the chart are three sections: **Poor**, **Needs improvement**, and **Good**. Each section aggregates metrics **by route**, showing:

- The route path (e.g., `/`, `/pricing`, `/blog/[slug]`)
- The percentile value for the selected metric
- **Data points** for that route

Use this to prioritize which routes to fix first.

## Filters

- **Device type:** `Desktop` or `Mobile`
- **Percentile:** `p50`, `p75` (default), and where supported `p90`
- **Time range:** `24h`, `7d`, `30d`, `90d`

> Filters apply to the chart and the route breakdown simultaneously.

## Device type

Switch between **Desktop** and **Mobile** to isolate platform‑specific regressions.

## Percentile

- **P50** reflects the typical user.
- **P75** (default) aligns with Core Web Vitals guidance and balances typical users with some long‑tail variance.
- **P90** widens the view to capture more long‑tail slowness.

## Time range

Choose the analysis window: **24h**, **7d**, **30d**, or **90d**. Short windows reveal fresh regressions; longer windows show trends.
